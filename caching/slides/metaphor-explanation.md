If you made all the ingredients of the sandwich at the moment people ordered them, the line would be even longer than normal.


What if, as the proprietor, you:

1. Had some ingredients ready the night before
2. Had the things that are personalized added later
3. Had the things that are the same for everyone ready already assembled


The way that a web application comes together often involves lots of different ingredients
that are ready ahead of time. Some are the same for everyone. Some are personalized. Some
can be prepared the day before and some need to be prepared right now.


Today, we're going to make a Bub and Pops fried chicken cutlet sandwich and talk about
some different kinds of caching along the way.


We'll look at:

* 🍅 Tomato Sauce 🍅
* 🍞 Bread 🍞
* 🐓 Chicken Cutlets 🐓
* 🍗 Frying of those Cutlets 🍗
* 🌿 Arugula 🌿
* 🧀 Cheese 🧀
* 📦 The packaging 📦


In our metaphor, the web request is _you_ asking for the sandwich... and the sandwich and all of its ingredients are the response.

Some of the ingredeints are prepped and ready to put together.

Some involve cooking or just in time preparation.

Some go bad quickly. Others last a looong time.
