##  Some Terms

Let's see if our metaphor breaks down!

See: [Basic Terms Related to Caching](http://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.3/caching-terms.html)


### Eviction

The removal of entries from the cache in order to make room for newer entries (typically when the cache has run out of data storage capacity).


### Eviction Example

There is only so much room in the restaurant. If you have fresh 🍞 it might make sense to toss out the stuff that's half a day old.


### Expiration

The removal of entries from the cache after some amount of time has passed, typically as a strategy to avoid stale data in the cache.


### Expiration Example

The fried 🍗 gets soggy and the 🌿 wilts. You have to toss it if you don't use it quickly.


### Hot Data

Data that has recently been used by an application is very likely to be accessed again soon.


### Hot Data Example

Keep that 🧀 handy and the 🍅 warm. They're going on every sandwich before it goes out.


### Invalidation

The removal of entries from cache manually.


### Invalidation Example

Throwing out a 🍗 from a 🐓 that had bird flu.
