<aside class="notes">
  <p>They grab this feed once every 15 minutes or so (there's no SLA)</p>

  <p>What's interesting about this?</p>

    <p>The streamUrl is the MP3 that Alexa will start playing. If we don't have that,
    she'll read the mainText in her own voice</p>

    <p>We learned that the ID can't change... we just change the streamUrl, updateDate, mainText, and titleText</p>

    <p>It's only one item. If you provide a list, Alexa will read all of them... and your Amazon rep will
    tell you if that's ok (hint: it's probably not).</p>

    <p>This isn't really like a regular feed - they're going to read the whole thing if you give it to them. In our case, we just added an implied limit of 1 to this. So this URL http://my.slate.com/proxies/alexa/audio_flash_briefing/?limit=20 would show 20 of them... albeit with the same ID.</p>
