<h2>Flash Briefing Cons</h2>

<ul>
  <li>"Flash Briefing?" srsly?</li>
  <li>There's no way for users to get more</li>
  <li>There aren't great stats</li>
  <li>The flash briefing is hard for users to find in their app (though, Amazon has told me they're going to surface this better given the usage they're seeing)</li>
  <li>No great user feedback, reviews, etc.</li>
  <li>You must work directly with Amazon</li>
</ul>
