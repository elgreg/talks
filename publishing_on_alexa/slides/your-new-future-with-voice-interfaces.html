<h2>Your New Future With Voice Interfaces</h2>

<aside class="notes">

  <p>I can still remember listening to the closing talk at South by southwest in 2012
when Bruce Sterling was predicting a future in which tech giants would all compete
to provide the same "stacks" of services before they all fail. Amazon, Google, Apple,
Facebook and Microsoft would all provide communication (email, chat), storage, photos,
videos, and music. A big part of your life would be figuring out how to choose the
right stack so that you didn't get overcharge, lose your memories, or become ostracized
from your social group.</p>

  <p>
  The next phase of the stacks for Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft
  looks to be digital assistants with Alexa, Hello, Siri, M, and Cortana. As publishers,
  we can try to meet users on all the stacks at once, but it takes a lot of work
  to do it well and be able to react to change quickly.</p>

  <p>Voice Interfaces are coming. Where typing and understanding graphical user interfaces
  were the previous barriers to entry for humans to interact with computers, advances in
  Natural Language Processing, neural networking and chip speed are making the Star Trek
  computer closer and closer to a reality.</p>

  <p>Structure your data and structure it well if you want to be able to publish on
  this emerging platform. Make sure your editors are thinking about how things will
  sound when read. What does a video sound like? What does that interactive poll sound
  like?</p>

  <p>I'd like to end on this note: in this new future, as publishers, we have to start thinking
    about even more platforms: the next customer of your content might not have a mouse, a keyboard or a phone.</p>
