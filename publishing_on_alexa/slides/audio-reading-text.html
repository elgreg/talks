<h2>Audio &gt; Reading text</h2>

<aside class="notes">
  <p>If you have the resources to produce your own Audio, Amazon will tell you how long or short
  they'd like you to make it. Hence why ours is called "90 Seconds with Slate" and
  not "71 minutes with the Culture Gabfest"</p>


  <p>If you aren't producing custom audio for each flash briefing, as many publishers aren't,
  you can have you content read by Alexa from the feed - allowing for a much less costly production
  and, likely, more current content.</p>
